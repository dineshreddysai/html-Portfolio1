<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Dinesh Reddy! I’m a web developer with in-depth experience in UI/UX
  design. In a nutshell, I create websites that help organizations address
  business challenges and meet their needs. I manage everything from website
  navigation and layout to a company’s web hosting and security architecture. My
  expertise lies within front-end web apps, and the main languages in my tech
  stack are JavaScript, React, and of course HTML/CSS. I’m a lifelong learner
  and love to read, run and play chess.
